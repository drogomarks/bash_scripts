# bash_scripts
Just a collection of bash scripts I have written, or tweaked for my own use. You may find some of the helpful. 


#### nginxS.sh
This still need work, but basically is an attempt to replicate the apachectl -S functionality with Nginx in that it gives you the domains and port information in the configuration.  Still needs some work, but works on most standard setups. 


#### vhosts.sh
Script that will take 3 arguments: -d <domain.com> -r </document/root/> -p <port number> and will created the virtual host for you, most of the script was written by Lindsey Anderson and more info on it can be found on justcurl.com, I only tweaked it to be used locally as a script that will take arguments.
